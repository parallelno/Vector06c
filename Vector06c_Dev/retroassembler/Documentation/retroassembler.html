<h2 id="Assembler">About the Assembler</h2>

<p>
Retro Assembler was created as a hobby project to work with source code targeting microcomputers and classic game consoles.
Hence the name Retro. I grew up coding a lot of demos and a few games on Commodore 64 and Plus/4, so the main target
was the 6502 CPU family, which is the closest to my heart. I happen to know I'm not alone with that feeling.
But I also worked on the Amiga and Gameboy Color, so the assembler was created in a way that it can support
multiple platforms with little effort on my part. Ultimately the goal is to support numerous CPUs and output formats,
and help the task of software development with neat assembler features.
</p>

<p>The application is being developed on Windows 11 in C#, using <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download" target="_blank">.NET 6.0</a></p>

<p>It runs on any platform where .NET 6.0 can be installed, including Windows, macOS and Linux, on X86, X64 and ARM architectures.</p>

<p>Run the Windows version with <i>retroassembler.exe</i>, and on other operating systems run the portable version with <i>dotnet retroassembler.dll</i></p>

<p>
If you use Retro Assembler, I would be happy to hear from you. You can tweet me at
<a href="https://twitter.com/Peter_Tihanyi" target="_blank">@Peter_Tihanyi</a> &ndash; I'd love to see what you do with it!
</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>


<h3 id="Assembler_AssemblerMode" style="break-before: page">Assembler mode</h3>

<p>
This is the default mode, where the assembler loads the main source file (with optional source file includes in it)
and compiles it according to the rules of the target platform. The default target CPU is 6502 and the full 32 bit address
space can be used for code and data.
</p>

<p>
The assembler works with separate memory banks and segments (using unique names).
When the end result is saved, it saves a file made of all segments in each separate bank. If multiple banks are in use,
the merged file names get a notation with the bank number. In case of a single bank (the default Bank 0), this info is omitted
from the filename.
<p>

<p>
If enabled in settings, the assembler saves each individual segment as well, separately, so if you use overlapping segments,
you can link them up manually as you please. It also can save a *-Info.txt report file which lists each bank and their segments,
with the minimum and maximum memory addresses used by each segment.
</p>

<p>
If the optional <i>Output file path</i> is not set, the assembler uses the input file's directory and name to build
the output file. For example the file <i>MyCode.asm</i> would be compiled and saved as <i>MyCode.bin</i>
</p>

<p>Usage</p>

<ul>
<li>Windows<br /><b>retroassembler.exe [options] &lt;input file path&gt; [output file path]</b></li>
<li>macOS, Linux (or Windows)<br /><b>dotnet retroassembler.dll [options] &lt;input file path&gt; [output file path]</b></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Assembler_DisassemblerMode" style="break-before: page">Disassembler mode</h3>

<p>
Optionally the assembler is capable of loading a binary file (software compiled to a certain supported CPU) and
disassemble it into a text file according to the rules of the target platform that the binary file was made for.
The disassembled code goes either to the standard output, or into the optional Output file as text.
</p>

<p>
When disassembling 65816 code, the disassembler tries to do its best to follow the state of the M and X registers
as they are being changed in the sequentially read code. Unless you set those from subroutines, the disassembler
will likely figure out whether the Accumulator and the Index Registers are in 8 or 16 bit mode, decoding the instructions
accordingly. This unfortunate ambiguity of the 65816 instruction set makes things a bit risky, especially that all
256 bytes are assigned to individual instructions. Once it goes off the track, it can decode completely false instructions
for a while before it accidentally finds the address of an actual instruction, and not just a half of one. But in the right
circumstances, it will work okay.
</p>

<p>Usage</p>

<ul>
<li>Windows<br /><b>retroassembler.exe -d [other options] &lt;input file path&gt; [output file path]</b></li>
<li>macOS, Linux (or Windows)<br /><b>dotnet retroassembler.dll -d [other options] &lt;input file path&gt; [output file path]</b></li>

</table>

<p>
There is an advanced mode for the load address option. You can also specify the start address in the memory and the length
of the code chunk that will be disassembled. Please note that these optional values are not handled as Offset and Length
for the binary file loader. The whole file will be loaded into the target memory, these only control what the disassembler
should turn into readable code.
</p>

<p><b>-D=&lt;LoadAddress&gt;,&lt;StartFrom&gt;,&lt;Length&gt;</b> <i>(Must be without spaces!)</i></p>

<ul>
<li><b>LoadAddress:</b> As explained above, this is where the file will be loaded into the target memory. <i>If the value is a negative number, it's used as an offset, so that many bytes will be skipped and the load address is set to 0.</i> If the loaded file is a PRG, SBIN or XEX file, this value is ignored because PRG, SBIN and XEX files start with a load address header. So for those type of files, you may set it to 0 or anything, it won't matter.</li>
<li><b>StartFrom:</b> The memory address where disassembling should start from. For example the file may be loaded to $2000, but disassembling can start from $3800.</li>
<li><b>Length:</b> Optionally, this non-zero value sets the number of bytes that will be disassembled. For example $80.</li>
</ul>

<p>Examples</p>

<pre>
//The file is loaded to $2000, but only the code between $3800-$3880 will be disassembled.
-D=$2000,$3800,$80

//A C64 file is loaded to $0801, but skip the BASIC RUN header and disassemble the whole file from $0810
-D=$0801,$0810

-D=0,$0810  //Does the same, since this example file was a PRG file with a known load address.

//The file is loaded to $0000, but only the code between $0740-$07c0 will be disassembled.
//The first $100 bytes of the file is ignored, for example it may be a header or something
//that's not part of the actual code file. (Note the negative number!)
-D=-$0100,$0740,$80

</pre>


<h3 id="Assembler_Integration" style="break-before: page">Integration into Projects</h3>

<p>
If you have a project that needs to integrate Retro Assembler for unit testing or for some other reasons, you can of course always just call
the assembler as a new process, capture its output to the console, read the files it generated...
</p>

<p>
But if you need to integrate it into a .NET 6.0 project, you can reference the <b>retroassembler.dll</b> file, add the Settings XML file(s) so they are
in the same directory with the DLL file after compilation, and you can call these functions from your application:
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>List&lt;byte&gt;</b> Assembler.UnitTestHelper.<b>Compile</b>(string filename)</li>
<li><b>List&lt;byte&gt;</b> Assembler.UnitTestHelper.<b>Compile</b>(List&lt;string&gt; args)</li>
<li><b>bool</b> Assembler.UnitTestHelper.<b>CompileAndCompare</b>(string filename, List&lt;byte&gt; knownGoodBytes)</li>
<li><b>bool</b> Assembler.UnitTestHelper.<b>CompileAndCompare</b>(List&lt;string&gt; args, List&lt;byte&gt; knownGoodBytes)</li>
<li><b>bool</b> Assembler.UnitTestHelper.<b>CompareBytes</b>(List&lt;byte&gt; bytes1, List&lt;byte&gt; bytes2)</li>
</ul>

<p>
I think these are fairly straightforward functions. You can either pass in the source filename (with full path) or your list of command line arguments
along with the source filename (with full path) as the last argument.
</p>

<p>
By calling <b>Compile()</b> you can grab the array of compiled bytes. It returns an empty array on error,
no error messages, but this should do for most projects.
</p>

<p>
By calling <b>CompileAndCompare()</b> you can send in an array of known good bytes for this source code's output binary file
and you simply get whether they are equal.
</p>

<p>
These functions were mainly made to make binary comparation simple with a single known good binary file in a unit test.
If you call it with a source code and settings that would save individual segments, use banks and other complex output schemes,
the resulting single byte array is possibly going to be incorrect and weird.

<p><b>Automatic CPU detection from file names</b></p>

<p>
Figuring out what CPU the source code file was made for is not trivial. You always should have a <a href="#Directive_Target">.target</a>
directive in the main source code file to select the correct CPU, but it's useful to have a fallback method for some special cases.
</p>

<p>You can tag your source code files with a special sub-extension, like this: <i>MyFile<b>.6502</b>.asm</i></p>

<p>
The assembler (and even the disassembler) will choose the correct CPU type for your file, automatically.
It was "invented" for the <a href="#Integration_VSCode">Visual Studio Code Extension support</a>, which really
needs some help to choose the correct language syntax, but it was easy to add it to the assembler itself as well.
Use the <i>main CPU type strings</i> above, not aliases.
</p>


<h3 id="Assembler_Updates">Updates and Version numbers</h3>

<p>
The assembler looks for updated versions periodically, unless it's disabled in Settings by setting <i>UpdateCheck</i> to False.
It's recommended to install the latest version when available, to get the newest improvements and bug fixes.
</p>

<p>
The version number style is <i>Year.Release</i>, for example <i>2020.3</i>
</p>


<h3 id="Assembler_Settings" style="break-before: page">Settings</h3>

<p>
The application has various command line switches that can change the assembler's behavior. You can set up your own
defaults in the <i>retroassembler-settings.xml</i> file for most of these, along with your preferred include paths.
Just be careful with future updates that would overwrite this customized file of yours.
</p>

<p>
To avoid such accidents, create the <i>retroassembler-usersettings.xml</i> file based on the normal settings Xml file,
where you can keep the settings you changed from their defaults. The assembler package will never contain (thus overwrite)
this file, but the assembler will always load this for your final settings. You should delete all &lt;Setting /&gt; lines
from it, except for the ones you actually changed with your custom values, just to make it clear for you to read.
</p>

<p>
Most settings can be set or changed in the source code files, using the <a href="#Directive_Setting">.setting</a> directive.
</p>

<p>The flow by which settings get their values:</p>

<ol>
<li>Each known setting gets initialized to a "good default" by the assembler itself.</li>
<li>These settings are also listed in the <i>retroassembler-settings.xml</i> file with the "good default" values, they are loaded and overwrite the defaults set in <i>Point 1</i>. You can edit these to set your own defaults, by following the rules of accepted value types, sane values etc. It's in your hands, literally. But you should just not edit this, and see <i>Point 3</i> instead.</li>
<li>Some of these settings may be listed in the custom <i>retroassembler-usersettings.xml</i> file with your "custom good default" values, they are loaded and overwrite the defaults set in Point 2. You can create this by duplicating and renaming <i>retroassembler-settings.xml</i>. It's best to keep only the customized settings in this file for clarity. <i>This file is optional. If it's missing, you will not get an error.</i></li>
<li>Certain settings are exposed as command line options, they can be updated that way for the loaded source code or binary file.</li>
<li>Most settings can be updated from the source code file itself, using the .setting directive. This allows for maximum customization for certain projects, while the rest use the defaults loaded from the Xml file.</li>
<li>A few special settings can only be managed from the source code file, they are not present in the Xml file.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Perhaps best practice would be changing the Xml file's defaults only for the values you can only edit in that file
(or you positively want to be the default in all your projects), and set up the rest from the main source code file's header,
with comments about why it changes those defaults. Make sure you have a backup of your good Xml file, because an updated version
of the assembler will overwrite your file if you're not careful. New versions may come with more or different Xml values.

%ffff_0000  //Binary value with optional value separator(s).

0o17        //Octal value with "zero + letter o"
</pre>

<p>Number values can go up to 32 bit unsigned values, or 31 bit signed values for negative numbers.</p>

<p>
In 8 bit systems it's useful to access a 16 bit value's lower byte and higher byte.
This can be done using the &lt; and &gt; modifiers entered directly in front of a label or number.
It's needed to set up interrupt vectors and other pointers in the code.
</p>

<pre>
Label  .equ $1234

       ldx #&lt;Label  //Same as ldx #$34  (lower byte of $1234)
       ldy #&gt;Label  //Same as ldy #$12  (higher byte of $1234)
</pre>


<h4>Preferred Number Size</h4>

<p>
In certain situations you may need to force a value into a different (always bigger) number size. For example in a
self-modifying code you may want to ensure you start out with a 16 bit value, but $0000 would normally be normalized to $00
which would generate an instruction with a different addressing format, different byte count.
</p>

<p>
You can enforce a different number size by prefixing it with extra "0" characters (<b>only in hexadecimal mode!</b>),
and if there is an addressing format for the chosen instruction that can handle it in the bigger size,
that specific addressing format will be chosen.
</p>

<pre>
sta $12,x        --&gt;  sta $12,x   ($95 $12)
sta $0012,x      --&gt;  sta $0012,x ($9d $12 $00)
sta 8 + $0012,x  --&gt;  sta $001a,x ($9d $1a $00)  (Expressions remember the preferred size.)
</pre>

<p>
This works with 16, 24 and 32 bit values, and you may prefix it with even just a single $0. As long as the number can be
stepped up to the next size, it will be done. Then it's up to the CPU's instruction set, whether it has what you need.
If the instruction doesn't exist with the 16 bit value for example, but your value was 8 bit to begin with, it will be
tried as an 8 bit value as well. A working code has higher priority over a possibly mangled code.
</p>

<p>
When it comes to expressions, the "preferred number size" is remembered after each operation made on two (or more) numbers,
but the 2nd number's preferred size is kept only in case of Addition or Subtraction. Which means, an
<i><nobr>sta $12 &amp; $00ff</nobr></i> will <i>not</i> suggest the compiler to save it as if you entered <i><nobr>sta $0012</nobr></i>
</p>

<h2 id="Expressions">Expressions and Operators</h2>

<p>
Expressions constructed of operators, values and Labels can be used in virtually any directive or instruction,
which allows for some clever code building mechanics.
</p>

<p>
Brackets (parentheses) can be used to form more complex expressions in directives, instructions and macro calls.
Be careful how you form them. It may be better to evaluate complex expressions into <a href="#Directive_Var">.var</a>
variables and use them in the instructions, but it's up to you.
</p>

<p>The available operators, in the order of evaluation:</p>

<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0">

<p>
Labels (including the Current Memory Address pointer) get replaced by their number value during expression evaluation,
and in directives it's required to use labels with prior definitions in order to build reliable code.
</p>

<p>
The comparers (<b>==&nbsp;&nbsp;!=&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;=</b> etc) and logical operators (<b>&amp;&amp;&nbsp;&nbsp;||</b>)
work best in <a href="#Directive_If">.if</a> and <a href="#Directive_While">.while</a> directives,
because their end result is either 1 for true, or 0 for false. If you use them with <a href="#Directive_Equ">.equ</a>,
you'll just end up with a 0/1 number that you can use as a flag.
</p>

<p>Examples</p>

<pre>

MyValue    .equ (MyConstant << 4) + 5

           .if MyValue >= 8 || OtherValue != 13
           (code lines)

           sta $0315
</pre>


<hr />


<h2 id="Labels" style="break-before: page">Labels</h2>

<p>
Labels (also known as Symbols) are constants or memory addresses that can be used in directives and instructions
as parts of expressions and operands.
</p>

<p>
A Label's name can only contain letters, numbers and the "_" character, and it can't begin with a number.
Single character Labels can't match a register name in the selected CPU type, for example "x" is not going to work as a Label
in 6502 mode. It's good practice to avoid using single character Labels if you can help it.
</p>

<p>
White spaces are usually ignored in the source code file. The only place where you must use a space or tab (or a colon)
as separator is between the main Label of the code line and the directive/instruction after it.
</p>

<p>
To maintain compatibility with other assemblers, if the Label is followed by a ":" (colon) character,
this character gets processed as white space. So "<i>MyLabel:</i>" is the same as "<i>MyLabel</i>",
you can format them either way.
</p>

<p>
The assembler shows a Warning when you define a Label as a standalone value in a source code line, and the Label is up to 4 letter characters.
This may be easily confused with a mistyped assembly instruction, so this is a help for the developer to detect such mistakes.
</p>

<p>If you need to save the used Labels into a Debug file (without specifying breakpoints), use this in your code:</p>

<pre>.setting "Debug", true</pre>


<h3 id="Labels_Normal" style="break-before: page">Normal Labels</h3>

<p>
The scope of a Normal Label (or a Global Label) is the entire source code, so they must be named uniquely.
However when they are defined inside a Macro's code block, their Namespace Context is limited for the Macro's
calling instance.
</p>

<p>
This means that multiple Macros can reuse the same Normal Label <i>"MyLabel"</i>, and a Macro can call another Macro
from inside its own code block without running into Label reusing issues. See more about this under <a href="#Directive_Macro">Macros</a>.
</p>

<p>
Labels can be defined the following ways:
</p>

<pre>
MyLabel      .equ $73  //MyLabel gets the constant value $73

MemAddress   lda #$00  //MemAddress gets the value of the current memory address, eg $0813
</pre>

<p>
Then the value of these labels can be used in directives and instructions with ease.
Keep in mind that only those labels can be used in directives, that have been defined before the directive's code line.
</p>

<pre>
MyLabel      .equ $73         //MyLabel gets the constant value $73

             lda #MyLabel+2   //lda #$75
             sta WhoKnows     //sta $0000 because WhoKnows is unknown
                              //and the therefore assembler assumes a 16 bit value.

MyNewLabel  .equ MyLabel+4    //$77

MyNewLabel2 .equ WhoKnows+4   //ERROR: The label WhoKnows is not defined yet.

MyLabel     .equ 55           //ERROR: The label "MyLabel" is already defined.

MyVariable  .var 10           //Create a variable with the initial value 10

MyVariable  .equ MyVariable+1 //The variable is updated to 10 + 1 = 11
MyVariable = MyVariable+1     //The variable is updated to 11 + 1 = 12
</pre>

<p>
You can use Labels almost anywhere. They will get replaced by the number value they hold (constant or memory address)
and this value will be used in calculations, or in determining the addressing type of certain instructions.
</p>

<p>
If the label's value is not known during the time the assembler gets to an instruction that uses it (in the 1st Pass),
the assembler assumes that it's 16 bit memory address for those instruction addressing types that work with memory addresses.
</p>

<p>
For example an "sta MyLabel,y" instruction placed before MyLabel's definition will be handled
as "sta $0000,y" (3 bytes) instead of "sta $73,y" (2 bytes), then in the 2nd Pass the code will be entered
as "sta $0073,y" (3 bytes) because the worst case was already assumed in 1st Pass,
in order to get the number of bytes that the instruction will take in memory.
</p>

<p>
So if you want to use zero page values for a faster code execution, define those labels before the code lines that try to use them.
</p>


<h3 id="Labels_Local" style="break-before: page">Local Labels</h3>

<p>
There is a Local Label type, that can be used with a limited scope. Defining a new Normal Label and using certain directives
close down the currently "open" Local Labels, by setting a range of start and end line numbers in the merged source code
where the Local Label can be addressed.
</p>

<p>
By having this automatic closure, the Local Label names can be redefined in various sections of the code.
Like small loop branches can simply utilize the same <i>"@Loop"</i> Label at most places, without running into any "label exists" errors.
</p>

<p>
Macro calls don't close down the previously created Local Labels, so you can define Locals before and after the Macro call, then reference these
from before and after the Macro's generated code block. See more about this under <a href="#Directive_Macro">Macros</a>.
</p>

<p>
The name must start with the "@" character, then any letter, number or the "_" character can be used in any combination.
This means that even the really simple "@1" is accepted as a Local Label name.
</p>

<p>Example</p>

<pre>
FillMem     ldx #$00
            lda #$ff
@Loop       sta MemAddress,x  //Define a new Local Label to "use it, then forget about it".
            inx
            cpx #$28
            bne @Loop  //Branches back to "sta MemAddress,x" as it should.
NewLabel    lda #$00
            beq @Loop  //ERROR: The @Loop Label can't be found, because the
                       //definition of NewLabel closed its range. 
</pre>

<p>
The Local Label ranges are closed by the directives .function, .loop, .while and their .end* counterparts.
</p>

<p>
It's recommended to use Local Labels inside Macro code lines, Functions, Ifs, Loops and Whiles, and wherever else you need labels with a short life span.
</p>


<!--
<h3 id="Labels_Regional" style="break-before: page">[DEPRECATED] Regional Labels</h3>

<p><b>The use of <i>@@Regional</i> Labels is deprecated, because Normal labels are Namespace Context dependant.
Macros no longer need to rely on utilizing <i>@@Regional</i> Labels. The assembler shows a Warning for each, and you need to update your source code.</b></p>

<p>
If you understand how Local labels like "@Loop" works, you will understand Regional labels too. They are almost the same,
labels with a limited scope. But unlike Local labels, these don't get closed down by the definition of a Global Label, or by
using directives .loop and .while.
</p>

<p>
They were designed to be used in <a href="#Directive_Macro">Macros</a> and <a href="#Directive_Function">Functions</a>,
so they stay open and available until an .endmacro or .endfunction directive is used. This allows the programmer to avoid
using Global Labels mainly in Macros (and also in Functions), which would lead to a "Global label exists" error when a Macro is referenced
in the source code more than once.
</p>

<p>
The name must start with "@@" characters, then any letter, number or the "_" character can be used in any combination.
This means that even the really simple "@@1" is accepted as a Regional label name.
</p>

<p>Example</p>

<pre>
.macro MyMacro()

FillMem     ldx #$00
            lda #$ff
@@Loop      sta MemAddress,x  //@@Loop is now a Regional label.
            inx
            cpx #$28
            bne @@Loop  //Branches back to "sta MemAddress,x" as it should.
NewLabel    lda #$00    //Defining a new Global Label here, that would close down Local labels.
            beq @@Loop  //It's OK! Compared to the Local label example above, this works fine.

.endmacro

            //Let's use this macro in our code.
            //It will inject the macro's code lines at place, with modifications.
            MyMacro()

            jmp @@Loop  //ERROR: The @@Loop label can't be found, because its range has been closed.
</pre>

<p>The Regional label ranges are closed by the directives .function, .endfunction, .macro, .endmacro</p>

<p>
<b>Known issue:</b> There is a limitation with Regional (and Local) labels. If you make a Macro function call inside a Macro,
the inner function closes the Regional labels when it exits. So jumping over an inner Macro function call using a Regional
label is currently not possible. Fixing this would require rewriting the parser and introducing namespaces, so this will
remain an issue until further notice.
</p>
-->

<h3 id="Labels_CurrentMemoryAddress" style="break-before: page">Current Memory Address</h3>

<p>
Another kind of label that's worth mentioning is the "<b>*</b>" (asterisk) character.
</p>

<p>"<b>*</b>" gets replaced by the current memory address, like $0813 during expression evaluation.</p>

<p>
Please note that the "<b>*</b>" character is also used in multiplications, so the assembler tries to determine the context
where the "<b>*</b>" character is used in, and acts accordingly.
</p>

<p>Examples</p>

<pre>
ldx #$07
dex
bne *-3   //Branches back to "ldx #$07"

jmp *     //Infinite loop to the memory address where the "jmp" instruction is.

MyLabel = *+$20   //The current memory address +$20 will be set as value for MyLabel.

MyLabel2 = 5 * 6  //MyLabel2 will get the value 30 due to the multiplication.
</pre>


<hr />


<h2 id="Comments">Comments</h2>

<p>
Comments can be placed at the end of any directive or instruction, or they can be the only content in a code line.
They are ignored by the assembler, so a code line that has been commented out is not processed at all. The comment
markers are <b>//</b> and <b>;</b> that work equally.
</p>

<p>
Block comments are also supported, where multiple code lines can be commented out, or the source code can contain
a bigger block of text without prefixing each line with the comment marker. The block comment markers are
<b>/*</b> for opening and <b>*/</b> for closing the block.
</p>

<p>Examples</p>

<pre>
MyLabel   lda #$0e   //This is a comment for the instruction.

MyLabel2  ldx #$06   ;This is also a comment, with the alternative comment marker ";".

MyLabel3  //ldy #$00 //Now this is just a line with "MyLabel3" in it, the instruction is ignored.

/* Some optional comment text, and the encapsulated code lines are ignored.
          sta $d020  //Ignored.
          stx $d021  //Ignored.
*/        nop        //The "nop" instruction is actually processed as valid code content.

</pre>

<hr />


<h2 id="Directives">Directives</h2>

<p>Directives are control commands for the assembler. The generally accepted format is:</p>

<pre>[label] .directive parameter(s) [comment]</pre>

<p>
Specific parameters and formatting exceptions will be explained in the description of each directive.
Certain directives have alternative names (aliases), they are interchangeable with the official name.
</p>

<p>Please note that Labels used as directive parameters must have prior definitions, meaning their value
(usually a constant or a memory address) must be defined <i>before</i> the directive code line in the source code.</p>


<hr />


<h3 id="Directive_Target">.target</h3>

<p>
Sets the target architecture by specifying the CPU type. It's a good practice to put this directive to the top
of every source file you have, so the assembler will know what kind of assembly language you used.
</p>

<p>
In theory one could make a project which compiles different source files, or even different sections of the same file
to different CPU types, but that should be avoided, and in the context of this assembler it wouldn't make much sense.
</p>

<p>See the <a href="#CPUTypes">supported CPU types</a> listed above. They are case insensitive.</p>

<p>
<b>Change!</b> This directive used to also set the memory size (max 128 MB) of the virtual memory buffer where the project's output
bytes are generated. This is no longer necessary, now a project can use the a full 32 bit address space.
The directive still takes a second parameter to preserve compatibility with existing source code files,
but this memory size parameter is ignored.
</p>

<p>Format</p>

The assembler can output the compiled code and data into a plain stream of bytes, but it also can handle various,
more or less complex file formats. You can pick one, depending on your project, ranging from plain Binary to
a Gameboy ROM cartridge format with complex headers and checksum calculation.
</p>

<p>
You can only choose one. If you enter multiple selections, the last one will be used to generate the output file.

<h3 id="Directive_Org">.org</h3>

<p>
Instructions and data bytes are always placed in the currently selected <a href="#Directive_Segment">memory segment</a>, 
right at the <i>Current Memory Address</i>, which is also called as <i>Program Counter</i>.
The Originate directive sets this pointer to a defined memory address, to control where the program will be compiled in memory.
</p>

<p>Format</p>

<pre>[label] .org MemoryAddress</pre>

<p>Optionally you can put a label in front of .org, then this label will get the selected address as value.</p>

<h3 id="Directive_Equ">.equ</h3>

<p>
Assigns a constant value to a Label, which later can be used as directive parameter, instruction operand, part of an expression etc.
The value may be a number, another Label with previous definition, or an expression that evaluates to a number.
Label values can be assigned only once, unless you use the <a href="#Directive_Var">.var</a> directive.
</p>

<p>If the Label is an existing entry marked as Variable, then this directive updates its value.</p>

<p>Format</p>

<pre>Label .equ Value</pre>

<p>The <b>=</b> character also can be used instead of .equ to make programming easier.</p>

<p>Examples</p>

<pre>
MyValue .equ 123         //Works only for the first time, unless it's a Variable.

MyValue = Start + $0200  //Works only for the first time, unless it's a Variable.

Counter = Counter + 1    //This is a Variable in our example, so this works anytime.
</pre>

<p class="alias">Alternative<span>=</span></p>


<hr />


<h3 id="Directive_Var">.var</h3>

<p>
Creates a Label marked as Variable. It has to be a Label that doesn't exist yet (neither as a Constant or a Variable),
and then it can be updated in the code with the <a href="#Directive_Equ">.equ</a> directive. Which has the shortcut "<b>=</b>",
so it can be just updated as <i>VariableName = NewValue</i>.
</p>

<p>Format</p>

<pre>Label .var Constant</pre>

<p>Example</p>

<pre>
Counter .var 10         //Create a Variable with the initial value 10.

Counter = Counter - 1   //Update the Variable's value, even by using expressions.
</pre>


<hr />


<h3 id="Directive_Random">.random</h3>

<p>
Creates a Variable (see the <a href="#Directive_Var">.var</a> directive) with a random value, between 0 to 255 by default, but the limits can be customized.
Afterwards this value can be used in the code, or can be modified the same way Variables can be modified.
</p>

<p>
The "seed value" for the random number generator is an important thing to mention. Each time the assembler runs, the
random number generator gets a new seed value, calculated from the current time of the computer's clock. This value gets
saved and restored between compiler passes, so the same random numbers will be generated in both passes for consistency.
</p>

<p>
If you need more control over the seed value before a random number is generated, it can be set by
<a href="#Directive_Setting">.setting</a> using "RandomSeed". For most projects the default seed would be just fine.
But if you need your code to generate the same random numbers every time it gets compiled,
you need to set your own Random Seed value.
</p>

<p>
If you need to generate one or more random bytes as data, use <a href="#Directive_Generate">.generate "random"</a>
</p>

<p>Format</p>

Updates a setting value in the default/current settings of Retro Assembler.
The defaults can be changed in <i>retroassembler-settings.xml</i> and then some of them can be overridden
by command line arguments when the assembler is launched. A few of these settings can't be changed using
this directive because they are needed during initialization.

<p>
The setting has to exist by name, and the value type has to be the same what the chosen setting expects.
The value types may be string, integer or boolean.

<p>If there is at least one breakpoint in the source code, the Debug file will be saved.</p>

<p>Note: This function doesn't work well with source code using multiple memory banks, for obvious reasons.</p>

<p>Format</p>

<pre>.breakpoint [IF Condition]</pre>

<p>Examples</p>

<pre>
nop

.breakpoint

lda CurrentColor

.breakpoint "A == $01"

sta $d021
</pre>

The output in the Debug file will be something like this:

<pre>
BREAKPOINT $0821
BREAKPOINT $0824 IF A == $01
NtscSystemFlag $0070
NtscPlayCounter $0071
irq $0855
CurrentColor $08b1
</pre>

<p>If all you need is saving the Debug file with the used Labels without specifying breakpoints, use this in your code:</p>

<pre>.setting "Debug", true</pre>

<h3 id="Directive_CloseLabels">.closelabels</h3>

<p>
This directive forcibly closes the range of currently opened (still addressable) Local and Regional labels.
It's mainly for unconventional use cases of Regional labels, should you decide to utilize them
<i>outside of a Macro or Function</i> for some reason. Then by using .closelabels you can reset these labels
for reusability reasons.
</p>

<p><b>Change!</b> With the removal of Regional labels, this directive is no longer useful.</p>

<p>Format</p>

<pre>.closelabels</pre>


<hr />


<h3 id="Directive_Print">.print</h3>

<p>
Prints the debug text on the console while compiling the code in the 2nd pass.
The parameters can be combinations of strings, numbers, labels and expressions. Value separating commas are optional.
</p>

<p>Format</p>

<pre>.print parameter(s)</pre>

<p>Example</p>

<pre>.print "The current memory address is " * ", how cool is that!"</pre>

<p class="alias">Alternatives<span>.debug</span></p>


<hr />


<h3 id="Directive_Error">.error</h3>

<p>
Prints a user raiser error message on the console while compiling the code in the 2nd pass and stops the compiler.
The parameters can be combinations of strings, numbers, labels and expressions. Value separating commas are optional.
</p>

<p>Typically it would be placed into an <a href="#Directive_If">.if</a> block.</p>

<p>Format</p>

<pre>.error parameter(s)</pre>

<p>Example</p>

<pre>
.if (* > $2010)
  .error "The current memory address is " * ", which is too high..."
.endif
</pre>


<hr />


<h3 id="Directive_End">.end</h3>

<p>
The loading and therefore processing of source code lines stop at the line where this directive is used.
</p>

<p>
This can't be used in conditional code like in an <a href="#Directive_If">.if</a> block because it gets processed
in the source code loading stage, so it will just leave an open <i>.if</i> as the last line of code.
</p>

<p>Format</p>

<pre>.end</pre>


<hr />


<h3 id="Directive_Include" style="break-before: page">.include</h3>

<p>
Includes the content of a source code file at the directive's code line, as if it was part of the
main source code file's contents. Include files may use the .include directive to load other files, up to 16 levels of depth.
</p>

<p>
If the file is without a full path, the assembler tries to find it in known include directories.
The defaults are the input source code file's directory, the assembler application's base directory and
the <i>include</i> directory under these two. The rest of the lookup directories can be set up in the retroassembler-settings.xml file.
</p>

<p>Format</p>

<pre>.include "filename.ext"</pre>

<p>Example</p>

<pre>.include "C64_Registers.inc"</pre>


<hr />


<h3 id="Directive_IncBin">.incbin</h3>

<p>
Loads a binary file into the current memory segment, either at the current memory address
(that you can control with a prior .org command), or at the memory location specified by the
file's 2-byte load address header in <i>auto</i> mode.
It's good for loading graphics assets, music and other data content, if you want to use the assembler as a linker.
</p>

<p>
If the file is without a full path, the assembler tries to find it in known Include directories.
The defaults are the input source code file's directory, the assembler application's base directory and
the <i>include</i> directory under these two. The rest of the lookup directories can be set up in the retroassembler-settings.xml file.
</p>

<p>
Unless you use the <i>auto</i> property, you can optionally set an Offset and even a Length,
to control what sections to load from a more complex binary file. But in this mode the file is loaded at
the current memory address, so make sure you set that up correctly beforehand.
</p>

<p>Format</p>

<pre>
.incbin "filename.ext", [Offset], [Length]

.incbin "filename.ext", auto
</pre>

<p>Example</p>

<pre>.incbin "music.bin" auto  //Load the file at $1000 where it belongs.</pre>


<hr />


<h3 id="Directive_Segment" style="break-before: page">.segment</h3>

<p>
Segments are handled as separate virtual memory buffers within the assembler. They can be used to separate
parts of the code, data blocks, memory banks on systems where they can be paged in, etc. Each segment belongs
to a chosen <a href="#Directive_Bank">memory bank</a>.
</p>

<p>
When a segment is first mentioned, it gets created. In further cases the assembler simply switches to the existing segment
by the same name and continutes to put instructions and data to the selected segment's current memory address.
</p>

<p>
If the bank number is missing from the first mention of a new segment, it gets created under the current bank.
The current bank is where the last used segment is hosted, or if a new bank was just created, then it's the new, empty bank.
</p>

<p>
The referenced bank number must exist already, set up by a previous .bank directive, otherwise the assembler returns with an error message.
</p>

<p>
When a new segment is created in a memory Bank, the first segment of the Bank always gets a specific start address set,
to the Bank's mapping address. Subsequent segments in the same bank are created as relocateable segments without a specific start address.
</p>

<p>
If the source code file doesn't specify a memory address (with <a href="#Directive_Org">.org</a>) in a relocateable segment
before the first instruction, the segment's contents will be relocated during compilation time,
right behind the previous segment's last used memory address.
</p>

<p>
If you put at least one instruction into a relocateable segment, you are no longer allowed to set a specific memory address
for the rest of the data in the segment. You have to create a new segment for those instructions or data bytes.
</p>

<p>
The assembler creates four standard segments by default: <i>Code</i>,<i>Lib</i>, <i>Data</i> and <i>BSS</i>, in this order,
all in the default Bank 0. These can be accessed with directive shortcuts.
The Code segment has a default start address of $0800 (or $0150 in a Gameboy project),
the others are created without a specific start address, meaning they can be relocated during code compilation.
</p>


<p>
At the end of code compilation, if there are multiple segments in actual use, the assembler saves a merged file for each Bank.
Optionally it can save each segment into individual files, by the setting "OutputSaveIndividualSegments".
</p>

<p>
The assembler also can save a "[CodeFileName]-Info.txt" file with information about each Bank and Segment used,
with lowest and highest memory addresses, so the saved individual segments can be loaded to the correct memory address
in your choice of linking method.
</p>


<p>Format</p>

<pre>.segment "Name", [BankNumber]</pre>

<p>Examples</p>

<pre>
.segment "Scroll", 0  //New segment "Scroll" into Bank 0.

.segment "Code"       //Choose existing segment "Code"


.bank 1, 16, $4000    //Create the new Bank 1

.segment "Tiles"      //Create a new segment "Tiles" in Bank 1, because Bank 1 is the current bank.

//Save individual segments in Bin/Prg/Txt formats
.setting "OutputSaveIndividualSegments", true
</pre>


<p>You may do rapid switching between segments to separate certain data types. For example:</p>

<pre>
.segment "Code"  //".code" would do the same, as shortcut.

(Scroller subroutine code lines)

.segment "Data"  //".data" would do the same, as shortcut.

.stext "hello, this is my scroll text!"
.byte ' ', $ff //End of the scroll text with an additional space before repeat.

.segment "Code"  //".code" would do the same, as shortcut.

(other subroutines)
</pre>

<p>
This way the scroller code and the scroll text can be kept near each other in the source code itself
(they may even come from an include file), but the Code and Data would still be separated in memory
during code compilation. In this example the scroll text bytes get placed after the <i>(other subroutines)</i>
instructions in the output binary file.
</p>


<hr />


<h3 id="Directive_Code">.code, .lib, .data, .bss</h3>

<p>
Shortcut to the default <i>Code</i>, <i>Lib</i>, <i>Data</i> and <i>BSS</i> segments, respectively.
It's the same as using the .segment directive with the selected segment's name, such as:</p>

<pre>.segment "Data"</pre>

<p>Format</p>

<pre>
.code
.lib
.data
.bss
</pre>

<p>Note that these segments are created in memory Bank 0.</p>


<hr />


<h3 id="Directive_Bank" style="break-before: page">.bank</h3>

<p>Creates a new memory bank, or updates an existing bank's properties.</p>

<p>
Memory banks act as a storage container for one or multiple memory segments. They don't do much for the typical
project for a computer using the 6502 CPU, because usually the maximum it can address is 64 KB. But for example
the Commodore 128 has 128 KB RAM and switchable memory banks, or a cartrige ROM can use switchable banks as well.
</p>

<p>
The real use for banks is with Gameboy projects, where anything larger than 32 KB needs to utilize ROM bank switching
on the cartridge.
</p>

<p>
Each project gets a Bank 0 created by default, with 64KB size, mapped to $0000.
The Code, Lib, Data and BSS segments are all created for Bank 0. If necessary, you can update this Bank 0's properties
with the .bank directive, to change its size and mapping address for special projects.
</p>

<p>
Optionally an Info string can be set for each bank. This is used in special cases, like the NES ROM format builder
identifies bank types and numbers by this value. You can read more about the <a href="#Output_Nes">NES output format here</a>.
</p>

<p>
It's mainly up to the developer to stay within the Bank's limits. Saving full banks can be enabled by the setting
"OutputSaveEntireBanks" (always on for Gameboy ROM output format) if that's what the project needs.
Since the size and mapping address is set for each Bank, the assembler, after code compilation, saves the banks
clipped down to the specific bank size. Code and data that's entered in the bank's segments <i>outside the bank's
boundaries</i> are thrown away. So if you have a bank that's 16KB in size and maps to $4000, then even if you have
code or data compiled to $8000+ in the virtual memory, those bytes will be ignored on save.
</p>

<p>If necessary, you can opt in to save individual segments beside the banks, without clipping applied.</p>

<p>
Bank numbers are zero based, and you may create gaps in the number of banks if you need to. The missing banks
will be filled in with $00 in a Gameboy ROM and in other possible file formats that rely on saving multiple banks.
The NES ROM builder doesn't use the bank numbers, only the Info strings.
</p>

<p>
If there is only Bank 0 created (which is likely for most assembly projects), the assembler doesn't deal
with banks, unless it's enforced in settings, or the output file format requires it. The output file names
will not be marked with the bank's number like "MyCode-Bank0.bin", it will be saved as "MyCode.bin"
</p>

<p>Format</p>

<pre>.bank BankNumber, SizeKB, MapAddress, [Info]</pre>

<p>Examples</p>

<pre>
.bank 0, 16, $0000  //Update the existing Bank 0 for a Gameboy ROM

.bank 1, 16, $4000  //Create Bank 1 for a Gameboy ROM

.bank 0, 16, $c000, "NES_PRG0"  //Create PRG Bank 0 for a NES ROM

//Save full banks with clipping in Bin/Prg/Txt formats
.setting "OutputSaveEntireBanks", true

//Save individual segments (without clipping) in Bin/Prg/Txt formats
.setting "OutputSaveIndividualSegments", true

</pre>


<h3 id="Directive_Namespace" style="break-before: page">.namespace</h3>

<p>
Labels are created in the Global Namespace by default. This one doesn't have a visible Namespace Name when the Labels are printed out.
You can change the current Namespace manually, if a section of your code needs to use a specific Namespace.
</p>

<p>
Macros create their own unique Namespaces, so you don't need to use this within Macros. But if you know what you're doing, the assembler won't stop you.
You can use this to access Labels and Values created outside the Macro in a specific Namespace. But it's important to note that labels created within a
Macro will always use the auto-generated Namespace that the Macro gets when it's called from your code. If you don't understand this statement,
you better don't use .namespace inside a Macro to avoid confusion.
</p>

<p>
When a Label is referenced, the system tries to find it inside the currently called Macro, or in the chosen Namespace (if applies), and if it's still
not found, it tries to find it in the Global Namespace. This way Global Label override and fallback can be achieved in expert mode.
</p>

<p>
The directive can be called with a specific name which should be unique. If somehow you specify a Namespace that a Macro uses when it's being called,
the outcome is undetermined. Best of luck to you!
</p>

<p>
When the name "Global" is used (it's checked in a case-insensitive way) then the assembler switches back to the default Global namespace.
The same thing happens when the directive is called without any Name string set, to provide an easy shortcut.
</p>


<p>Format</p>

<pre>
.namespace "MyCustomNamespace"

.namespace "Global"  //Case insensitive lookup for "global", switches to the Global Namespace.

.namespace           //Switches to the Global Namespace as a shortcut.
</pre>

<h3 id="Directive_Region" style="break-before: page">.region</h3>

<p>
Regions are logical blocks that encapsulate one or more source code lines.
This directive is ignored by the assembler, but can be used in certain text editors to fold regions on demand.
It's just like the #region directive in Visual Studio, purely a visual element.
</p>

<p>This directive must be closed by using <a href="#Directive_EndRegion">.endregion</a></p>

<p>Format</p>

<pre>
.region [Region name as free text]

(Code lines)

.endregion
</pre>


<hr />


<h3 id="Directive_EndRegion">.endregion</h3>

<p>
Closes the previously opened <a href="#Directive_Region">.region</a> directive, so the encapsulated source code lines can be folded in certain text editors.

<hr />


<h3 id="Directive_Function" style="break-before: page">.function</h3>

<p>
Functions are logical blocks that encapsulate one or more source code lines, that are meant to be called as a subroutine.
They don't have calling parameters, and internally this directive just converts the function's name into a Label.
</p>

<p>
Functions can be called in the code using "FunctionName()". The assembler replaces this with the target CPU's "call subroutine" instruction,
for example "jsr FunctionName" for 6502 code, or with the appropriate instruction for other CPU types.
</p>

<p>This directive must be closed by using <a href="#Directive_EndFunction">.endfunction</a></p>

<p>
<b>Important change</b> is the addition of the Setting <i>OmitUnusedFunctions</i>.
This signals to the assembler that unused (unreferenced, not called) Functions should be removed during compilation time. This is helpful if you want
to use Functions to build a Library that you can include in several projects, and only the parts that are actually used will be added to the project.
Usage is detected in the main source code, in Macros that are actually called, and in Functions that are actually called, with recursive lookup.
</p>

<p>This behavior can be turned on by using <i>.setting "OmitUnusedFunctions", true</i> anywhere in the source code.</p>

<p>Format</p>

<pre>
.function FunctionName()

//Or as a friendly alternative...
.function FunctionName
</pre>

<p>Example</p>

<pre>
.function Scroller()

lda #$07
sta $d016
(other code lines)

.endfunction  //Serves as the "return from subroutine" instruction, eg "rts".
</pre>

<p>Calling example</p>

<pre>
lda #$0f
sta $d020

Scroller()  //Same as "jsr Scroller".

Lda #$00
sta $d020
</pre>

<p>
Please note that you can't open a new .function or .macro inside a Function,
but you are free to use .loop, .if and .while directives.
</p>


<hr />


<h3 id="Directive_EndFunction">.endfunction</h3>

<p>
Closes the previously opened <a href="#Directive_Function">.function</a> directive.
The assembler replaces this with the target CPU's "return from subroutine" instruction,
for example the "rts" instruction for 6502 code, or with the appropriate instruction for other CPU types,
so the subroutine can return automatically after the last code line. You may put your own "rts" instruction into the function
at the point of your chosen return, but at the end the assembler will always add an "rts" as closure.
</p>

<p>Format</p>

<pre>[Label] .endfunction</pre>

<p>Examples</p>

<pre>

<p class="alias">Alternative<span>.endf</span></p>


<hr />


<h3 id="Directive_Macro" style="break-before: page">.macro</h3>

<p>
Macros are logical blocks that encapsulate one or more source code lines, that are compiled into
the segment memory at the place of the macro call, using the arguments set by the macro call.
</p>

<p>
A Macro can have zero, one or more parameters. Each parameter can optionally get a default value,
in case the parameter is not specified in the macro call itself. If you don't set a default value
for a parameter, it will be handled as number 0 and you better set a value for that parameter
during the actual macro call, unless you happen to need 0 there.
</p>

<p>
The parameter names don't actually get created as Global Labels, so you can reuse parameter names or
you can use names that you defined as a Label elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
Macros can access Global Labels that were defined outside of the Macro. But when Normal Labels and Local Labels
are defined inside the Macro, those will be stored under the Macro's own Namespace Context. This means that
more than one Macro can define the same Label like <i>"MyLabel"</i>. These won't create Global Labels and <i>"MyLabel"</i>
will be unique for each Macro, and also for each call of that Macro in the source code.
</p>

<p>
As mentioned, you can and should use Local Labels like @Loop, @1 etc for those throwaway Labels.
When a Macro is called, the assembler keeps the Local Labels open (defined) and you can define a Local Label
after a Macro call, then for example conditionally jump to it from in front of the Macro call, it will work.
</p>

<p>
Due to the Namespace Context that Macros and their Labels use, it's not an issue to call a Macro from inside a Macro,
and so on and on, up to a level you are comfortable with.
</p>

<p>
<b>For Experts,</b> the Normal Labels defined under a Macro can be reached from outside of the Macro call, by something like this:
<i>"MyMacro_2.MyLabel"</i> Since these are somewhat unique for each and every Macro call, you can find your desired Label
in the Debug text file or in the optional Label printer (calling option "-x") but you only need this if you really want to jump back
into the middle of a Macro's generated code from the rest of the source code for some hacky reason.
</p>

<!--
<p><b>Important Note:</b> In previous versions the Namespace Context for Labels didn't exist, so you had to use <i>@@Regional</i> Labels
inside a Macro to overcome certain limitations. This is no longer an issue, therefore the <i>@@Regional</i> Labels are deprecated.
They will be completely removed in a later version of the assembler.
</p>
-->

<p>
As this might be a bit complicated, so pay attention to the example below where I'll try to highlight the features.

SetColors()            //Use the default values $06 and $0e for the colors.
</pre>

<p>Note that we never set a value for <i>MemAddress</i>, so it keeps reading the value from memory address $0000.</p>

//SetColor() macro for SNES which enters an RGB value into the selected color.

<!--
<p>
<b>Known issue:</b> There is a limitation with Regional (and Local) labels. If you make a Macro function call inside a Macro,
the inner function closes the Regional labels when it exits. So jumping over an inner Macro function call using a Regional
label is currently not possible. Fixing this would require rewriting the parser and introducing namespaces, so this will
remain an issue until further notice.

<p>
This example is intentionally simplistic, but you can do some clever things with loops, especially
if you keep modifying a <a href="#Directive_Var">variable</a> value inside the loop, and use that value as a code modifier.

<h3 id="Directive_If" style="break-before: page">.if</h3>

<p>
If blocks are logical blocks that encapsulate one or more source code lines, that get compiled into
the segment memory only if the conditional value or expression evaluates to <i>1</i> (true).
</p>

<p>Since it works with expressions, arithmetic and logical comparisons etc, it can be a rather powerful tool.</p>

<p>This directive must be closed by using <a href="#Directive_EndIf">.endif</a></p>

<p><i>Further .if directives can be nested under an .if, just indent the code to make it easier to follow.</i></p>

<p>
The .if directive block does not close @Local labels, so the code can reference local labels created before and after the block.
You can define @Local labels inside an .if block, but if you want to reference it from outside the block, it will only compile
if the .if block's condition was true, therefore it was compiled into the code.
</p>

<p>Format</p>

<pre>.if Condition</pre>

<p>Example</p>

<h3 id="Directive_While" style="break-before: page">.while</h3>

<p>
While blocks are logical blocks that encapsulate one or more source code lines, that get compiled into
the segment memory in a loop, as long as the conditional value or expression keeps evaluating to <i>1</i> (true) during each iteration.
</p>

<p>Since it works with expressions, arithmetic and logical comparisons etc, it can be a rather powerful tool.</p>

<p>
Given how easy it is to get into an endless loop with a badly set condition, you must be careful with this.
Having some <a href="#Directive_Var">variable</a> like a counter or other value that is constantly
(or just sometimes) updated inside the block is key.
</p>

<p>
If the loop cycle reaches 100000, the parser will take it as an infinite loop detection and will return with an
error message. If you need more loop cycles to achieve what you need, you will need to find a different solution.
</p>

<p>
You may use the <a href="#Directive_Break">.break</a> directive to terminate the loop on a chosen condition set by the <a href="#Directive_If">.if</a> directive.

<h3 id="Directive_Align" style="break-before: page">.align</h3>

<p>
Aligns the upcoming instructions or data to the next "round" memory address.
The alignment value must be the power of 2, such as <i>2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64</i> etc, up to 1 megabyte.
</p>

<p>
If the filler byte is not set, the bytes only get allocated in memory without setting a byte value for them.
This makes it possible to align purely allocated bytes too.
</p>

<p>
Alignment works in relocatable <a href="#Directive_Segment">memory segments</a> as well.
</p>

<p>Format</p>

<pre>[label] .align Alignment, [Filler byte]</pre>

<p>Examples</p>

<pre>
//Align code/data to the next round $xx00 memory address, only allocate the skipped bytes.
.align $100

//Align code with 6502 NOP instructions
.align $80, $ea

<hr />


<h3 id="Directive_Storage">.storage</h3>

<p>
Preserves the following <i>Length</i> number of bytes in the memory to be used as storage bytes.
</p>

<p>
If the filler byte is not set, the bytes only get allocated in memory without setting a byte value for them.
This can be used to mark an array in memory, outside the compiled binary file's saved bytes, to be used by the program.
For example in a Gameboy game the compiled code is in ROM banks, but the RAM from $c000 can be preserved using allocated bytes.
It's better to use this to allocate an array, instead of just making a label for it, especially if the array is followed
by similarly allocated bytes and words by using <i>ButtonState .byte ?</i> etc.
</p>

<p>Format</p>

<pre>[label] .storage Length, [Filler byte]</pre>

<p>Examples</p>

<pre>

This directive generates byte values at the current memory address,
depending on the selected Mode, and on the Parameter(s) that the Mode expects.
Usually these are data tables that can be utilized for demo effects.
</p>

<p>
Each Mode has default parameters that they can fall back to if a parameter is not provided,
but it wouldn't hurt to set each parameter to your liking to avoid strange results.
</p>

<p>
Depending on what the generator does, if the resulting data values can't be saved in a single byte
when an 8-bit CPU is targeted (for example making a sinwave between $00 and $03ff values with the 6502 CPU selected),
the generator creates two identically sized data outputs in a row.
First the Low Bytes, then the High Bytes of each corresponding data value.

Some <b>undocumented</b> (also called as illegal) instructions are also supported using the optional -u switch.
They are described on <a href="http://www.oxyron.de/html/opcodes02.html" target="_blank">oxyron.de</a>
(which is an awesome demo scene group, check out their work) but as a brief recap, here are the supported instructions
and their aliases:
</p>

<pre>
ahx, alr, anc, arr, aso, asr, axs, dcp, hlt, isb
isc, jam, kil, lar, las, lax, lse, nop, rla, rra
sax, shx, shy, slo, sre, tas, xaa
</pre>

<p>
Instead of using <b>dnp</b> or <b>tnp</b> or other variants for double and triple <b>nop</b>, the assembler
uses the actual <b>nop</b> mnemonic with various addressing types. These are actually useful in demos, the
other undocumented instructions not so much, and those can be unstable on different CPUs.
</p>

<pre>
nop #$nn     //$80, uses 2 CPU cycles
nop $nn      //$03, uses 3 CPU cycles
nop $nn,x    //$14, uses 4 CPU cycles
nop $nnnn    //$0c, uses 4 CPU cycles
nop $nnnn,x  //$1c, uses 4 CPU cycles, +1 for crossing a page boundary
</pre>

<p>
These nops can be useful in precise timing, or the <i>nop $nnnn</i> variant is a good way to temporarily comment out
a <i>jsr</i> or <i>jmp</i> instruction, by replacing their opcode with $0c in a self-modifying code. Then the memory address
they refer to remains intact, the instruction gets ignored by the CPU, and it can be restored when needed.
</p>

<p>
Mind you, 65C02, 65SC02 and 65C816 use these opcodes to implement new instructions, so if you want 100% compatibility
with those CPUs, just refrain from using illegal instructions, including the above mentioned NOPs.
You can just use "bit $1234" to temporarily disable a <i>jsr</i> or <i>jmp</i> instruction.

<p>
Due to the changes in this CPU, some instructions may be saved a way you don't expect it:
</p>

<pre>
brk $12  --&gt;  $00 $12
brk      --&gt;  $00 $00

cop $12  --&gt;  $02 $12
cop      --&gt;  $02 $00
</pre>

<p>
The 65816 deals with some unfortunate ambiguity when it comes to instruction opcodes. For example the instructions
<nobr>lda #$12</nobr> and <nobr>lda #$1234</nobr> use the same $a9 opcode, which makes it hard to figure out what's going on
just by reading the bytes in a file. How they should be handled is decided by CPU flags for the Accumulator (M) and for
the Index Registers (X) that you need to set up in your code by the instructions "sep" and "rep". These take a bitfield
value, where each 1 bit sets or resets the corresponding CPU flag.
</p>

<p>
The disassembler attempts to deal with this by following the changes in the M and X flags in sequential code.
</p>

<p>
The assembler gives the control to you. If you enter <nobr>lda #$12</nobr>, that will be saved as $a9 $12. If you enter
<nobr>lda #$1234</nobr>, that will be saved as $a9 $34 $12, even if you didn't actually change the M flag yet.
</p>

<p>
In cases like the CPU is set to 16 bit Accumulator mode and your value happens to be an 8-bit number
(or anything smaller than what you need), you may enter it with a <a href="#ValueTypes_Numbers">Preferred Number Size</a>,
like <i><nobr>lda #$0012</nobr></i>. This will tell the compiler that the value should be stored on 16 bits.
It works with 24 bit values too, for example <i><nobr>sta $000012</nobr></i> or <i><nobr>sta $001234,x</nobr></i>
if you must do that.
</p>

<p>
If you don't want to manage this so closely, in case of the 65816 you can use two setting values that you can modify via
the <a href="#Directive_Setting">.setting</a> directive. <a href="#Assembler_Settings_Hidden">RegA16 and RegXY16</a>
can tell the compiler that from now on, until the setting is set to false again, all immediate addressings should be handled
in 16 bit mode. For example <i><nobr>lda #$12</nobr></i> will be handled as if you typed in <i><nobr>lda #$0012</nobr></i>
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>RegA16</b> controls the instructions that work with the accumulator (<i>lda, and, adc, cmp</i> etc)</li>
<li><b>RegXY16</b> controls <i>ldx, ldy, cpx, cpy</i></li>
</ul>

<p>
You may set up macros that turn the CPU flags and these settings on and off to make the code less error-prone.

<p>
The instruction NOP doesn't really exist in this CPU with that mnemonic.
The EOM instruction (End of Map) is used as the counterpart of the MAP instruction,
but in other cases it simply operates as a NOP, using the same $EA opcode that the 6502 uses.
Therefore you can use NOP in your code if you need to, but the disassembler will see those as EOM.
</p>

<p>
This CPU adds the Z register, which unlike in the 65C02 is an actual register and doesn't just mean Zero when you use STZ.
A few instructions also use the SP stack pointer register. In 45GS02 mode the CPU can use the Q pseudo-register which is the
combination of the A, X, Y and Z register values to form a 32-bit value.
</p>

<p>
Some instructions in 45GS02 mode have a [ZEROPAGE_ADDRESS],Z addressing mode, which allows for referencing a 32-bit
memory address indirectly. In the example below, imagine we put 4 bytes from to $72-$75: $80, $c0, $01, $00.
This would correspond to the memory address $0001c080 which is clearly outside the 16-bit address space that could use the maximum value of $FFFF.
By using this addressing mode, and using the Z register as an index value, we can access any part of the memory without memory bank mapping.
</p>

<pre>
//Values at $72-$75: $80, $c0, $01, $00 for $0001c080
//Put $ff into the memory at $001c083
ldz #$03
lda #$ff
sta [$72],z  //Note the [] square brackets!

//The instruction STA [$72],Z gets compiled like this:
eom          //$ea      -- The same as NOP, used as an opcode prefix.
sta ($72),z  //$92, $72 -- Note the () round brackets!
</pre>

<p>
The 45GS02-specific Q pseudo-register instructions and these 32-bit addressing modes are accessed by using NOP and/or NEG as opcode prefixes,
so even just the opcode of certain instructions can end up being a combination of 2-4 bytes. The disassembler handles these
nicely, but you can look at your 45GS02 code disassembled in 4510 mode to see what's going on under the cover.

ld a,(hld)
ldd a,(hl)

ld (hl-),a
ld (hld),a

<p>
Most instructions that normally just imply working with the "a" register can be written as showing the "a"
register, just in case that's how you like it. Some examples:
</p>

daa    =  daa a

cpl    =  cpl a

and a  =  and a,a

and b  =  and a,b

and c  =  and a,c
</pre>

<p>
The assembler tries to be compatible with existing RGBDS source code files, so the brackets in the addressing modes
that use them are accepted with square brackets <nobr>"[ ]"</nobr> as well.
</p>

<p>
A "nop" is placed behind each "halt" and "stop" instruction during code compilation to avoid hardware issues.
This behavior can be changed in the Settings Xml file, but it's recommended keep it this way.

register pair with its background counterparts. This apostrophe (') character at the end may cause your text editor
go haywire due to an unclosed character literal, so it's recommended to write this instruction without that.
The assembler handles it both ways.
</p>

<pre>
//This instruction...
ex af,af'

//Is the same as...
ex af,af
</pre>


<p>
Some <b>undocumented</b> (also called as illegal) instructions are also supported using the optional -u switch.
The only unique instruction by mnemonic is <b>sll</b>, but there are a bunch of otherwise standard instructions
with undocumented addressing modes that you can utilize, if needed.
</p>

<p>
This usually may not apply to pure Z80 source code, but similarly to the Nintendo Gameboy CPU mentioned above,
the assembler tries to be compatible with existing RGBDS source code files, so the brackets in the addressing modes
that use them are accepted with square brackets <nobr>"[ ]"</nobr> as well.
</p>

<hr />


<h2 id="Output">Output File Formats</h2>

<p>
The assembler is capable of saving the compiled bytes from the target memory banks in various formats.
Some are generic, others are system specific. For example it makes no sense to save 65c02 code in
Gameboy ROM format, or NES code in a T64 format, even though the NES uses the 6502 CPU similar to Commodore computers.
</p>

<p>
The output file format can be selected from the command line eg <i>-O=prg</i>, or using the
<a href="#Directive_Format">.format</a> directive eg <i>.format "prg"</i>
</p>


<h3 id="Output_Bin">BIN &ndash; Binary file</h3>

<p>
Binary file with <i>.bin</i> extension. It contains the compiled memory bytes, from the first used memory address
to the last used one. If it's chosen in Settings, it may be an entire memory bank. The unset bytes and memory gaps
are always filled with $00.
</p>

<p>
This file contains no meta information about the load address, it's always up to the user to load the file to the
correct memory location.
</p>


<h3 id="Output_Prg">PRG &ndash; Binary file with load address header</h3>

<p>
Program file with <i>.prg</i> extension. It's the same as a <a href="#Output_Bin">Binary file</a>, but the load address
is saved as the first few (typically 2) bytes of the file to identify the correct memory location. This is the format that Commodore
computers use.
</p>

<p>
The load address is stored using the target CPU's endianness and address width. Meaning, 8-bit CPUs like the 6502 in
Commodore computers store the address on the first 2 bytes, where an address like $0801 is stored as bytes $01, $08.
</p>

<p>
Projects for other CPUs may use this format as well, it's not limited to the 6502. For a 16 or 32 bit CPU the address
header takes up 4 bytes because the load address is stored on 32 bits.
</p>


<h3 id="Output_SBin">SBIN &ndash; Binary file with load address and data length header</h3>

<p>
Binary file with <i>.sbin</i> extension. It's the same as a <a href="#Output_Bin">Binary file</a>, but the load address
is saved as the first few (typically 2) bytes of the file to identify the correct memory location, along with typically 2 bytes
of file data length.
</p>

<p>
The load address is stored using the target CPU's endianness and address width. Meaning, 8-bit CPUs like the 6502 in
Commodore computers store the address on the first 2 bytes, where an address like $0801 is stored as bytes $01, $08.
</p>

<p>
The following data length is stored in a similar fashion, and on a typical 8-bit CPU it takes 2 bytes. If the file length
would be bigger than 64 kilobytes, the length value is capped at $ffff.
</p>

<p>
For a 16 or 32 bit CPU the addresses in the header will take up 4 bytes each because the load address is stored on 32 bits
and the files are typically bigger than 64 kilobytes.
</p>


<h3 id="Output_T64">T64 &ndash; Tape image format for Commodore computers</h3>

<p>
Tape image file with <i>.t64</i> extension. Used by Commodore computers (emulators), it's basically a tape
with one or more files on it, up to maximum 30 files. The files are saved as <a href="#Output_Prg">PRG files</a>
with load address header on each of them. Use this only for 6502 and perhaps for 65C02 / 65816 projects.
</p>


<h3 id="Output_D64">D64 &ndash; Disk image format for Commodore computers</h3>

<p>
Disk image file with <i>.d64</i> extension. Initially it's created as a <a href="#Output_T64">T64 file</a> so it can hold
up to maximum 30 files. Then it's converted to D64 using the VICE emulator package's program "c1541". The path to this VICE
directory has to be set up in the <i>retroassembler-settings.xml</i> file, in the <b>VicePath</b> value.
</p>


<h3 id="Output_Txt" style="break-before: page">TXT &ndash; Configurable text file format</h3>

<p>
ASCII text file with <i>.txt</i> extension. It contains the compiled memory bytes from the first used memory address
to the last used one. If there are gaps in the memory, the unused bytes are skipped and the continuous bytes are organized
into Areas. The output for a file may look like this:
</p>

<pre>
c000 78 d8 a2 40 8e 17 40 a2
c008 ff 9a e8 8e 00 20 8e 01
c010 20 8e 10 40 2c 02 20 10
c018 fb a9 00 95 00 9d 00 01
c020 9d 00 02 9d 00 04 9d 00
c028 05 9d 00 06 9d 00 07 a9
c030 fe 9d 00 03 e8 d0 e2 2c
c038 02 20 10 fb a9 80 8d 01
c040 20 4c 41 c0 40 40

fffa 44 c0 00 c0 45 c0
</pre>

<p>
Nearly every aspect of the text file format can be customized via the <a href="#Assembler_Settings_OutputTxt">OutputTxt Settings</a>.
The values are printed using the .Net <i>string.Format()</i> function, but if you're not familiar with it, here is a primer.
</p>

<p>
A string value like "{0:x04} " means that the Parameter 0 (which is the number being printed) should be in hexadecimal format,
padded up to 4 characters with 0s, in lower case, with a space after it. For example $1ab would be shown as "01ab ".
</p>

<p>
"{0:X02}" would mean the number should be in hexadecimal format, padded up to 2 characters with 0s, in upper case (mind the upper case X in the string).
For example $0d would be shown as "0D".
</p>

<p>
"{0}" would mean the number should be in decimal format, without any padding. For example $0d would be shown as "13".
</p>

<p>
The rest of the settings are fairly obvious, they are about where to put spacing, where to put newline characters and what
they should be like. I chose the Windows standard "\r\n" for default values. You may also control how many bytes should be
printed into a single line.
</p>


<h3 id="Output_AtariDos">XEX &ndash; Binary file with data chunks and launcher for Atari DOS</h3>

<p>
Binary file with <i>.xex</i> extension. It contains one or more <i>Chunks</i> of data, and also an optional Launcher to
auto start the program after loading. The Atari DOS has the capability of running code in certain chunks, depending on
where they are loaded in the memory, while the file is being loaded. This way the program can do a system compatibility check,
display a hero image and continue loading afterwards, so the user is not bored during long load times.
</p>

<p>
This separation of Chunks is achieved by using <a href="#Directive_Segment">Segments</a>. By default the code is entered
into the "Code" segment (shortcut: <a href="#Directive_Code">.code</a>) so in case of smaller programs, the code can be
written without any extra setup, and it just needs the optional Launcher segment to enable auto start after loading.
</p>

<pre>
        .target "6502"

        .setting "OutputFileType", "AtariDOS"  //or "XEX"

//Start writing the program itself. It will start at $0600.

        .org $0600

//Create a "Start" label that points to the first line of the executable.

Start   lda #$00
        nop
        rts

//Create a "Launcher" segment which will load this auto start address
//where the "Start" label points to, into the memory at $02e0
//Then the computer will start the program there, at $0600 in this example
//after the file is loaded.

        .segment "Launcher"

        .word Start

//Note that the label "Start" is just an example. It can be named freely.
</pre>

<p>
If you need to use multiple Chunks at different memory addresses, create multiple Segments
and specify the starting memory address in each using the <a href="#Directive_Org">.org</a> directive.
</p>

<p>
The Segment named <i>"Launcher"</i> gets special handling. The memory address of it doesn't matter and
only the first 2 bytes get loaded, even if you specify more in it.
</p>

<p>
You can of course opt not to use the <i>"Launcher"</i> segment, you can skip it altogether, or implement
it yourself manually, by a code like this:
</p>

<pre>
.segment "My Own Auto Start"

.org $02e0

.word Start
</pre>

<p>
Like with any Segment, the assembler will use the starting memory address of the code or data written into the Segment,
and set the data length according to the byte content length of the Segment itself.
</p>

<p>
It's important to know that the Segments are processed in the order of creation, which means that the default <i>Code, Lib, Data, BSS</i>
segments are created first, if they contain any bytes of code or data. If you must start your program file by loading a certain
segment that comes before your main program needs to be loaded, do it accordingly. Either put the very first segment's data into the
default <i>"Code"</i> segment, or skip using these segments altogether and just create your own ones like "Initializer" etc
from the beginning. Empty segments are not saved, and the <i>"Launcher"</i> segment is always saved as the last Chunk in the file.
</p>

<p>
Hint: If you want to place the <i>"Launcher"</i> segment on top of your code for clarity or for code standardizing,
make sure you put a ".code" at the end of those lines of code, before any other parts of your program, so it switches
back to the default <i>"Code"</i> segment for subsequent source code lines.
You can also choose to put the whole Launcher segment creator into a Macro.
</p>

<pre>
.macro Launcher(StartAddress)

.segment "Launcher"

.word StartAddress

.code

.endmacro
</pre>

<p>
Of course your mileage may vary here with the segment creation and switching, but I'm sure you will figure this one out.
</p>


<h3 id="Output_Gb" style="break-before: page">GB &ndash; Nintendo Gameboy ROM format</h3>

<p>
Nintendo Gameboy ROM file with <i>.gb</i> extension. This format uses a special header and memory banks.
The scope of this document doesn't allow for a Gameboy development tutorial, but you may consult the attached example.
</p>

<p>
In a nutshell, the Gameboy uses a custom CPU with some RAM and switchable memory banks that are 16KB each. Bank 0 is
always mapped at $0000, other banks are mapped at $4000.
</p>

<p>
The Gameboy ROM builder identifies the banks by their bank number, the Info string is not in use (unlike for NES ROMs).
If all you want to build is a 32KB ROM where you don't use bank switching, just use the default Bank 0 and the linker will
handle it as a 32KB bank between $0000-$7fff.
</p>

<p>Multiple banks should be used like this:</p>

<pre>
//The Main bank 0, mapped to $0000
.bank 0, 16, $0000

//Other banks, mapped to $4000
.bank 1, 16, $4000
.bank 2, 16, $4000
.bank 3, 16, $4000
</pre>

<p>
The ROM format requires having a special header between $0100-$014f, which includes the Nintendo logo, creator info,
cartridge descriptors and calculated checksum values. The ROM builder handles all that for you. The number of banks is detected
and missing banks are padded up for a valid ROM size. You will need to set up the Reset and Interrupt vectors on the zero page,
but the jump at $100 to the starting point of your program is generated by the linker. A typical Gameboy program starts at $0150,
the assembler automatically sets this address for the entered code in Bank 0 by default.
</p>

<p>
You may choose your own Memory Bank Controller (MBC) type, but realistically, look at the calendar... Unless you have some
super special needs, just set the other <i>GameboyCartridge...</i> setting values and the linker will figure out which MBC5
cartridge type you need. Just write your bank switching code according to the MBC5 specification and call it a day.
</p>

<p>
See the <a href="#Assembler_Settings_Gameboy">Gameboy ROM format Settings</a> that you can set up for your project, it covers
everything you need to build a valid Gameboy ROM file with header. Set these with the <a href="#Directive_Setting">.setting</a>
directive from your main source code file.
</p>


<h3 id="Output_Nes" style="break-before: page">NES &ndash; Nintendo Entertainment System ROM format</h3>

<p>
Nintendo Entertainment System ROM file with <i>.nes</i> extension. This format uses a special header and memory banks.
The scope of this document doesn't allow for a NES development tutorial, but you may consult the attached example.
</p>

<p>
In a nutshell, the NES uses a 6502 CPU with minimal RAM and switchable Program (PRG) and Character (CHR) banks.
The latter is specifically for graphics, tiles and sprites. PRG banks are 16KB each, CHR banks are 8KB each.
</p>

<p>
The NES ROM builder identifies the bank types and their sequential numbers solely from the Info string parameter
of the <a href="#Directive_Bank">.bank</a> directive.
</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<pre>
//The Main PRG bank, mapped to $c000
.bank 0, 16, $c000, "NES_PRG0"

//Another PRG bank, mapped to $8000
.bank 1, 16, $8000, "NES_PRG1"

//This PRG bank will be ignored by the linker because NES_PRG2 is missing,
//so it stops collecting PRG banks and goes ahead to collect CHR banks.
.bank 2, 16, $8000, "NES_PRG3"

//The first CHR bank, mapped to $0000 (doesn't matter, it's not code)
.bank 3, 8, 0, "NES_CHR0"

//The second CHR bank, mapped to $0000 (doesn't matter, it's not code)
.bank 4, 8, 0, "NES_CHR1"

//Special, completely optional "Trainer" bank, mapped between $7000-$71ff
//Just set 1 KB size, only the first 512 bytes will be taken from it.
.bank 5, 1, $7000, "NES_Trainer"
</pre>

<p>
The assembler bank numbers don't matter for NES ROMs, only the numbers in the Info string. So you can even make PRG banks use
0-99, CHR banks use 100-199, Trainer use 200... It's all up to you. But when it comes to the bank numbers in the
Info strings, they have to start from 0 and be continuous. The linker will start looking for "Does NES_PRG[number] exist?"
and increment the number. If it doesn't find the PRG bank by the currently checked number, it goes ahead to look for CHR banks
and stops at a missing bank number there as well.
</p>

<p>
You can use a lot of PRG and CHR banks, even more than 255 each if you need to. The linker utilizes some of the
<a href="https://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/NES_2.0" target="_blank"><i>NES 2.0 ROM format extensions</i></a> so you can build
mega ROMs.
</p>

<p>
See the <a href="#Assembler_Settings_Nes">NES ROM format Settings</a> that you can set up for your project, it covers
everything you need to build a valid NES ROM file with header. Set these with the <a href="#Directive_Setting">.setting</a>
directive from your main source code file.
</p>


<h3 id="Output_Snes" style="break-before: page">SNES &ndash; Super Nintendo Entertainment System ROM format</h3>

<p>
Super Nintendo Entertainment System ROM file with <i>.sfc</i> extension. This format uses a special header and memory banks.
The scope of this document doesn't allow for a SNES development tutorial, but you may consult the attached example.
</p>

<p>
In a nutshell, the SNES uses a 65816 CPU with minimal RAM and switchable memory banks that may contain code, graphics or
other data. There are two versions of the memory bank layout:
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>LoROM:</b> The banks are 32 KB in size, mapped between $8000-$ffff. There are 128 banks to use. (4 MB)</li>
<li><b>HiROM:</b> The banks are 64 KB in size, mapped between $0000-$ffff. There are 64 banks to use. (4 MB)</li>
</ul>

<p>
The ROM builder supports all possible SNES ROM settings in theory, they can be set up in the header, but the non-standard ROM
types and sizes will require additional work on the user's side to make the ROM file valid. The standard (or accepted)
ROM sizes are handled well and the checksum values are calculated correctly for those. The SNESPadding setting is True
by default, meaning it will pad the ROM with extra empty banks at the end of the file to reach the (next) valid ROM size,
which are the following:
</p>

<p><i><nobr>256KB (2 MBit)</nobr>, <nobr>512KB (4 MBit)</nobr>, <nobr>1MB (8 MBit)</nobr>, <nobr><u>1.5MB (12 MBit)</u></nobr>, <nobr>2MB (16 MBit)</nobr>, <nobr><u>3MB (24 MBit)</u></nobr>, <nobr>4MB (32 MBit)</nobr></i></p>

<p>
The memory banks are used by their bank number (not by the Info string parameter, like in the NES ROM format),
starting from 0 and collected sequentially. Gaps between banks are filled with empty banks. The bank size is determined by
the SNESHiROM setting, which is False by default, meaning the LoROM format is in use with 32 KB banks by default.
</p>

<p>
The ROM header is generated in Bank 0, between $ffc0-$ffdf, and (as far as I know) the interrupt vectors are always
in Bank 0, from $ffe0 (technically from $ffe4).
</p>

<p style="break-before: page">LoROM setup example (32 KB banks)</p>

<h3 id="Output_Sms" style="break-before: page">SMS &ndash; Sega Master System ROM format</h3>

<p>
Sega Master System ROM file with <i>.sms</i> extension. This format uses a special header and memory banks.
<i>This is the same as the Sega Game Gear format.</i>
The scope of this document doesn't allow for a Sega development tutorial, but you may consult the attached example.
</p>

<p>
In a nutshell, the SMS and GG use a Z80 CPU with some RAM and switchable memory banks that are 16KB each. Bank 0 is
always mapped at $0000, other banks are mapped at $4000 or $8000, mostly the latter. By convention, Bank 0 and Bank 1
(or just a 32KB Bank 0) are mapped in by default in the first 32KB, and the other banks, if available, should be mapped at $8000.
</p>

<p>
The Gameboy ROM builder identifies the banks by their bank number, the Info string is not in use (unlike for NES ROMs).
If all you want to build is a 32KB ROM where you don't use bank switching, just use the default Bank 0 and set it to 32KB in size.
</p>

<p>Multiple banks should be used like this:</p>

<pre>
//The Main bank 0, mapped to $0000
.bank 0, 16, $0000

//The (other) Main bank 1, mapped to $4000
.bank 1, 16, $4000

//Other banks that will be mapped to $8000
.bank 2, 16, $8000
.bank 3, 16, $8000
</pre>

<p>Or like this, which is essentially the same:</p>

<pre>
//The Main bank 0 in 32KB size, mapped to $0000
.bank 0, 32, $0000

//Other banks that will be mapped to $8000
.bank 1, 16, $8000
.bank 2, 16, $8000
</pre>

<p>
The ROM format requires having a special header between $7ff0-$7fff, which includes an identifier string, product code,
country code, ROM size and a calculated checksum value. The ROM builder handles all that for you. The number of banks is detected
and missing banks are padded up for a valid ROM size. The valid ROM sizes are 32KB, 64KB, 128KB, 256KB and 512KB.
</p>

<p>
See the <a href="#Assembler_Settings_Sms">SMS &amp; GG ROM format Settings</a> that you can set up for your project, it covers
everything you need to build a valid SMS/GG ROM file with header. Set these with the <a href="#Directive_Setting">.setting</a>
directive from your main source code file.
</p>

<p>
There is another semi-standard header, called <a href="http://www.smspower.org/Development/SDSCHeader">SDSC Header</a>
placed between $7fe0-$7fef with information about the ROM and its developer. The ROM builder doesn't create this,
but you can do so manually with ease in the source code, if you want to support this in your ROM file.

<p>
This is exactly the same as the <a href="#Output_Sms">Sega Master System</a> ROM format, but with a <i>.gg</i> extension
that helps emulators differentiate between system types. Both use the Z80 CPU, ROM banks and the same header format.

<p>
ZX Spectrum 48K Tape file with <i>.tap</i> extension. This format is limited to 48 KB of data, between $4000-$ffff.
The scope of this document doesn't allow for a ZX Spectrum development tutorial, but you may consult the attached example.
</p>

<p>
The ZX Spectrum uses the Z80 CPU and its 48K version has 48 KB of RAM, mapped between $4000-$ffff. The first 16 KB
is occupied by the ROM, which contains a BASIC interpreter and system routines. While there is a 128K version of this
computer, the TAP file format is restricted to 48 KB in this case. Future expansions are possible, if there is demand for it.
</p>

<p>
The Tape file has multiple headers and data blocks. To make it work in an emulator (or on a real ZX Spectrum), it has to
start with a BASIC loader. First this program gets loaded into the memory and when it's executed, it loads and runs the
compiled binary file.

The assembler enters the TapClear setting value into line 30 (defaults to $5fff), and the TapStart setting value into line 60
(defaults to $8000) to customize the BASIC loader for the compiled code's needs.
</p>

<p>
The ZX Spectrum's graphics memory is allocated between $4000-$5fff (roughly), so programs should be loaded from $6000, and in
many cases programs start at $8000. This is up to the developer. According to my tests, even programs loaded to $4000 start up
fine in the Speccy emulator, but the screen gets messy due to writing into the graphics memory. The Spectrum loads the BASIC
program from about $5c00 (just outside the graphics memory) so loading files from $6000 is safe, without the risk of
overwriting this small BASIC loader's program. The TAP file builder ignores data you may put below $4000 and above $ffff.
</p>

<p>
If you are wondering how the Spectrum games load a picture first, and then the game itself, it's done with multiple data
blocks in the TAP file. First a BASIC loader is entered, which loads an image file from $4000, then the code/data file
from $6000 or higher.
The TAP file builder doesn't support this, it's for testing code, so if you are planning to write a game with a hero image,
you will need some other utility to link up your final code.

<h2 id="Integration">Integration with Text Editors</h2>

<p>
Source code for Retro Assembler can be written by using any text editor, but it's best to use something that supports
user defined languages and syntax highlighting. I made support for two, these might be the most popular code editors today.
</p>

<p>
If you create a syntax highlighter for your favorite editor, I would be happy to hear from you.
It can be added to the assembler package and its documentation with proper crediting.
</p>


<h3 id="Integration_VSCode">Visual Studio Code</h3>

<p>
<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com" target="_blank">Visual Studio Code</a> is a powerful, multi-platform IDE
from Microsoft. If you don't have a chosen IDE for assembly development, just go with this one.
</p>

<p>
I created an Extension for it which makes VS Code work with Retro Assembler quite well.
It can be downloaded from the Marketplace inside VS Code, just search for "retro assembler" or visit this page:
<a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EngineDesigns.retroassembler" target="_blank">VS Code Extension for Retro Assembler</a>
</p>

<p><b>Make sure you read the Readme of the extension itself in VS Code about how to set it up.</b></p>

<p>You can set up keyboard shortcuts and the assembler path to compile (and even auto-start) your code directly from the IDE.</p>

<p>
VS Code has a bit of an issue with identifying the correct CPU type for the viewed source code file, but you can use the
<i>MyFile.6502.asm</i> automatic CPU detection from file name hack <a href="#Assembler_CpuTypes">explained above</a>,
or you can set a default language syntax for the assembly files. This is also covered in the Readme file.
</p>

<p>
You should consider using the Retro Assembler Light or Dark theme included with the extension, because it will do
correct colorization of normal and undocumented instructions, directives etc. I've done what I could to make it look OK
with other themes, but the mess of VS Code theme styles is a story for another day. The extension will be updated with
new features and coverage for future assembler versions.
</p>


<h3 id="Integration_Notepad">Notepad++</h3>

<p>
<a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/" target="_blank">Notepad++</a> is a small but powerful text editor.
It was the first editor I made support for to turn it into an IDE. It can use User Defined Languages with
syntax highlighting by colorization, folding of comments, functions and macros, and also regions.
</p>

<p>
You can set this all up by clicking at the menu item <i>Language -&gt; Define your language...</i>
and import one (or any/all) of these files that came with the assembler's package, using the <i>Import...</i> button.

<p>After this you must <b>restart Notepad++</b> so it will utilize the imported file(s) correctly.</p>

<p>
The automatically recognized source code file extensions within Notepad++ will be "<b>.asm, .s, .inc</b>",
like "<i>musicplayer.asm</i>", but you can change these or add more by going back to the language editor.
Select a <i>Retro Asm CPU</i> language and edit the <i>Ext.</i> field on the top.
</p>

<p>
Whether Notepad++ can recognize the file by extension is questionable, especially if you install language files
for more than one CPU. You may have to choose the edited file's language manually in the <i>Language</i> menu.
There is no support for the <i>MyFile.6502.asm</i> automatic CPU detection from  file name hack
<a href="#Assembler_CpuTypes">explained above</a> &ndash; I tried to add it to the extension list and it doesn't work.
Maybe in a future version of Notepad++.

<p>
<i>6/16/2020</i><br />
<ul>
<li><b>Version 2020.12 released</b></li>
<li>Empty Macros get removed from the compiled code automatically.</li>
<li>When the Setting <i>OmitUnusedFunctions</i> is Enabled, empty Functions and their standard calls get removed from the compiled code.</li>
<li>When the Setting <i>Debug</i> is Enabled, a text representation of the compiled code is saved alongside with the normal debug information. You can change its default filename in the Setting <i>DebugCodeFile</i> or in the Settings Xml file.</li>
<li>When the Setting <i>OutputSaveInfoFile</i> is Enabled, now Atari DOS (.xex) files create the Info file about memory usage.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<i>6/11/2020</i><br />
<ul>
<li><b>Version 2020.11 released</b></li>
<li>Bug fixed in the parser where an <i>lda &lt;Label</i> or <i>lda &gt;Label</i> (and similar zero page instructions) would process the memory address of Label incorrectly, when Label is defined after the instruction's code line.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<i>5/29/2020</i><br />
<ul>
<li><b>Version 2020.10 released</b></li>
<li>Setting <i>DefaultScreencode</i> added to control the encoding Type and Case that the ".stext" directive uses for text conversion.</li>
<li>When a file is included using the ".include" or the ".incbin" directive, the file's Directory is automatically added to the list of Known Include Directories. This way a file loaded with full path can include subsequent files without specifying the full path of those nested files.</li>
<li>The Setting <i>OmitUnusedFunctions</i> is no longer Enabled by default to avoid issues with existing source code. It can be enabled on demand.</li>
<li>Fixed the issue of Long Branch Handling not working in Macros.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<i>5/17/2020</i><br />
<ul>
<li><b>Version 2020.9 released</b></li>
<li>Serious code generating bug fixed in the Long Branch handler.</li>
<li>ATASCII and ScreencodeAtari text encodings added in the ".encoding" directive.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<i>5/16/2020</i><br />
<ul>
<li><b>Version 2020.8 released</b></li>
<li>New directive ".lib" added as a shortcut to the new default "Lib" Segment. Short for Library where included Functions may be stored. This is placed between the Code and Data Segments.</li>
<li>Setting <i>OmitUnusedFunctions</i> added to control whether unused Functions should be omitted from the compiled binary. It's enabled by default which may break some existing projects.</li>
<li>If <i>OmitUnusedFunctions</i> is enabled, the assembler identifies those Functions that have not been actually called anywhere in the source code and removes them from the compiled binary. This is helpful if you want to build and include a large Function and Macro library, but only use a few of those in your project. If this is an unwanted behavior, the feature can be turned off in Settings.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<i>5/13/2020</i><br />
<ul>
<li><b>Version 2020.7 released</b></li>
<li>New directive ".format" added to replace Setting <i>OutputFormat</i>. The setting itself still works, but shows a warning.</li>
<li>The ".if" directive block no longer closes @Local labels, so you can reference @Local labels created before and after the ".if" block.</li>
<li>Setting <i>HandleLongBranch</i> added. When enabled, the assembler automatically fixes Branch Out of Range errors by replacing the branch instruction with its counterpart instruction and an absolute jump to the branch address. In Z80/Gameboy mode <i>jr</i> instructions get replaced by <i>jp</i> instructions. It's not enabled by default.</li>
<li>Setting <i>AllowUndocumentedInstructions</i> added and set to True by default. This makes undocumented instructions enabled for participating CPUs, but you can disable this manually in your source code (or in the Settings Xml file) if you want to turn them off.</li>
<li>The -u command line switch for undocumented instructions is now used only in Disassembler mode, where it matters to select it from the command line.</li>
<li>The -L command line switch has been replaced by -l, but the old switch option still works.</li>
<li>Setting <i>LaunchEnabled</i> has been renamed to <i>Launch</i>. The old name still works, but shows a warning.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<i>5/9/2020</i><br />
<ul>
<li><b>Version 2020.6 released</b></li>
<li>New directive ".namespace" added. This can change the currently used Namespace for Labels and Values to a custom one, or switch back to the default Global Namespace.</li>
<li>Random mode added for the ".generate" directive to generate a set of random bytes.</li>
<li>The Disassembler processes Atari DOS .XEX files to utilize the Chunk load addresses.</li>
<li>For developers: If you need to use Retro Assembler in your project that needs it, check out the section <a href="#Assembler_Integration">Integration into Projects</a>.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<i>5/4/2020</i><br />
<ul>
<li><b>Version 2020.5 released</b></li>
<li>New output file type added: Atari DOS binary format with load data chunks and launcher. It uses the .xex file extension.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<i>4/25/2020</i><br />
<ul>
<li><b>Version 2020.4 released</b></li>
<li>Labels now utilize Namespaces, so Macros can simply use Normal labels without running into duplication issues or generating Globally accessible Labels.</li>
<li>Each Macro creates its unique Namespace when called from the source code, with a unique "_INSTANCENUMBER" modifier at the end.</li>
<li>When Labels are printed out, or added to the Debug text file, they are shown as Namespace.LabelName, with unique instance number modifiers. <i>(This is best to be checked out in the Debug output, and many users may never need to see or use them.)</i></li>
<li>Calling Macros from within Macros work much better due to using Namespaces.</li>
<li>For experts, Normal Labels within Macros can be referenced from outside, like "MyMacro.InnerLabel" for the first, or for example "MyMacro_2.InnerLabel" for the 2nd instance of MyMacro's usage.</li>
<li>The scope of Local labels is no longer closed down automatically after a Macro call. You can refer to a Local label defined before or after the Macro call.</li>
<li>Regional labels (eg <i>"@@MyLabel"</i>) are now deprecated because they are no longer needed inside Macros. The compiler shows a Warning for each, so the source code can be fixed. The Regional labels feature will be completely removed in a later release.</li>
<li>Setting <i>DebugAddLocalLabels</i> added to enable adding Local labels into the Debug text file. This is enabled by default.</li>
<li>Setting <i>ShowLocalLabelsAfterCompiling</i> added to enable printing Local labels too, along with the Normal labels.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<i>4/22/2020</i><br />
<ul>
<li><b>Version 2020.3 released</b></li>
<li>Support for the following Intel CPUs has been added: 4004, 4040, 8008, 8080, 8085</li>
<li>Visual Studio Code extension and Notepad++ files updated to support the new CPUs.</li>
<li>Launch your compiled program automatically using the debugger of your choice via the settings <i>DebugCommand</i> and <i>Debug</i>.</li>
<li>VS Code's <i>Retro Assembler: Build &amp; Debug</i> command works by overriding the <i>Debug=false</i> setting using the -g switch.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<i>4/17/2020</i><br />
<ul>
<li><b>Version 2020.2 released</b></li>
<li>A Debug file containing Labels, Memory Addresses and Breakpoints can be saved on demand by using <i>.setting "Debug", true</i></li>
<li>This Debug file format can be customized in the User Settings XML file because every debugger is different.</li>
<li>The ".breakpoint" directive now uses the Debug file and its format settings. If you miss the old VICE Monitor output settings, you can customize the file to work like that.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<i>2/20/2020</i><br />
<ul>
<li><b>Version 2020.1 released</b></li>
<li>The assembler is now built exclusively for .NET Core 3.1 and it runs on Windows, macOS and Linux as a single package.</li>

<i>10/19/2019</i><br />
<ul>
<li><b>Version 2.4.2 released</b></li>
<li>Fix for the case of calling a Macro with more parameters than what it has in its definition.</li>
<li>The "[CodeFileName]-Info.txt" file is no longer saved by default. You can turn it on by the <i>OutputSaveInfoFile</i> setting either in the User Settings XML file, or in your project using the ".setting" directive.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<i>5/31/2019</i><br />
<ul>
<li><b>Version 2.4.1 released</b></li>
<li>Errors and warnings are printed with a clickable link that allows Visual Studio Code to open the referenced source code file at the problematic line number.</li>
<li>New output file type added: SBin with load address and data length header.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<i>4/4/2019</i><br />
<ul>
<li><b>Version 2.4 released</b></li>
<li>New directive ".encoding" added. It controls how the directives .text and .textz turn strings into bytes.</li>
<li>New directives ".textz", ".ascii" and ".asciiz" added for finer control over text strings.</li>
<li>Directive aliases ".txt", ".st" and ".stxt" dropped to make things clearer.</li>
<li>The directive ".debug" has been renamed to ".print", but ".debug" is still an accepted alias. Alias ".out" dropped.</li>
<li>New directive ".error" added. It prints a user raiser error message on the console and stops the compiler.</li>
<li>Error handling has been improved in source code processing.</li>
<li>Standalone labels now produce warnings if they look similar to instructions, which may be a typo in the source code.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<i>2/13/2019</i><br />
<ul>
<li><b>Version 2.3.1 released</b></li>
<li>Fix for Mono on Ubuntu Linux and other operating systems.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<i>11/13/2018</i><br />
<ul>
<li><b>Version 2.3 released</b></li>
<li>The directives ".align" and ".storage" now only allocate bytes in memory, if the "filler byte" parameter is not set.</li>
<li>The directives ".byte", ".word" and ".dword" can allocate bytes in memory, when the value is set to "?"</li>
<li>New directive ".end" added. It terminates the source code loading at that line, the rest of the lines are ignored.</li>
<li>Boolean values "true" and "false" now work everywhere where you expect them to work (directives equ, var, if, while, macro arguments)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<i>10/15/2018</i><br />
<ul>
<li><b>Version 2.2.1 released</b></li>
<li>Using of single character Labels is allowed (used to be forbidden), as long as it's not a match to a Register name in the selected CPU type. For example you can't use <i>a / x / y</i> as label names in 6502 code, but <i>b / c / d</i> are allowed.</li>
<li>Functions made by the .function directive no longer require brackets for the function definition, but they are still needed for the function call. It's just for alternative formatting.</li>
<li>Bug fix: The -L command line option for <i>LaunchCommand</i> broke earlier, it's been fixed. VS Code can launch the compiled files again.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<i>10/1/2018</i><br />
<ul>
<li><b>Version 2.2 released</b></li>
<li>Z80 CPU support added with standard and undocumented instructions.</li>
<li>Sega Master System ROM (.sms) output format implemented.</li>
<li>Sega Game Gear ROM (.gg) output format implemented.</li>
<li>ZX Spectrum 48K Tape (.tap) output format implemented.</li>
<li>The expression evaluator has been improved, now it can handle complex expressions (using parentheses) in Instructions and Macro calls too.</li>
<li>Bitwise-NOT number manipulation implemented in the expression evaluator. It flips the bits of the number value that follows the '~' character. The number is analyzed and only the occupied bit width in use gets manipulated, so it works for 8, 16, 24 and 32 bit numbers as you would expect it to work. For example <i><nobr>Label = ~$1000</nobr></i> sets value <i>$efff</i> for the label, and <i>~$01</i> turns into <i>$fe</i></li>
<li>BeforeBuild and AfterBuild added into Settings, to execute one or more commands before and after the build. See the Settings documentation for details because these are special.</li>
<li>OutputFormat is now an alias of OutputFileType in Settings.</li>
<li>VS Code Extension updated, Register color tweaked.</li>
<li>Notepad++ support files updated, Register color tweaked.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<i>8/23/2018</i><br />
<ul>
<li><b>Version 2.1.1 released</b></li>
<li>Check for updates implemented. The assembler checks for a newer available version periodically and will notify you when there's something new to download. It's useful, but you can be disable it in settings.</li>
<li>Launch your compiled program automatically using the emulator or utility of your choice via the settings <i>LaunchCommand</i> and <i>LaunchEnabled</i>.</li>
<li>VS Code's <i>Retro Assembler: Build &amp; Start</i> command now works by overriding the <i>LaunchEnabled=false</i> setting using the -L switch.</li>
<li>Now you can create the file <b>retroassembler-usersettings.xml</b> based on the <i>retroassembler-settings.xml</i> file, where you can keep the settings you changed from their default values. Updated assembler packages are not going to overwrite this new Xml file, but will always load the final settings from it. This way you'll never risk losing your custom settings by installing an update.</li>
<li>The automatically mapped <i>include</i> directories now are also mapped as <i>Include</i> for case-sensitive file systems, such as on Linux.</li>
<li>VS Code Extension updated. The extension's files are no longer included in the assembler package, it can be downloaded from the Marketplace.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<i>8/20/2018</i><br />
<ul>
<li><b>Version 2.1 released</b></li>
<li>65816 CPU support added with new addressing types and mnemonics.</li>
<li>New boolean settings <i>RegA16</i> and <i>RegXY16</i> to force the compiler to use 16 bit immediate values in 65816 mode, for example <i><nobr>lda #$12</nobr></i> will be compiled as <i><nobr>lda #$0012</nobr></i>, if <i><nobr>RegA16 = true</nobr></i></li>
<li>Semi-intelligent disassembler support for 65816 with Memory and Index flag state following to correctly decode 16 bit values (it only works for sequentially placed instructions). For example: <i><nobr>lda #$1234</nobr></i> vs <i><nobr>lda #$34</nobr> + misidentified instruction with $12</i></li>
<li>The disassembler's -D option got advanced values support for code offset and length settings.</li>
<li>New number formats: <i>0b11110000</i> for binary (alternative), <i>0o12</i> for octal numbers.</li>
<li>Binary and hexadecimal numbers can use optional section separators for readability purposes: <i>%1111_0000</i>, <i>0b11_11_0000</i>, <i>$aa_bb</i> etc</li>
<li>Hexadecimal numbers can get a "preferred number size" by prefixing them with "0" characters, for example <i><nobr>lda $0012,x</nobr></i> will be compiled as <i><nobr>$9d $12 $00</nobr></i> instead of the normal <i><nobr>$95 $12</nobr></i> for <i><nobr>lda $12,x</nobr></i></li>
<li>New instruction aliases for 6502-based CPUs: <i>bcc = blt, bcs = bge</i></li>
<li>The .target directive now has an alternative directive: .cpu</li>
<li>Super Nintendo Entertainment System ROM (.sfc) output format implemented with LoROM/HiROM support.</li>
<li>VS Code Extension and Notepad++ support files updated.</li>
</ul>

<li><b>Version number updated to 1.1.1 for this quick fix release.</b></li>
<li>Linux support added in form of making the application Mono compatible. File paths are handled correctly, using the system-native directory path separator.</li>
<li>The default Include directories are located both as "Include" and "include" (lowercase) to support case-sensitive file systems.</li>
<li>The default output directory of the ".memorydump" directive is now the input source code file's directory.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Version 1.1 released</b></li>
<li>The .memorydump directive is now capable of saving binary files, too.</li>
<li>New directive ".memory" added to manipulate bytes in a selected memory segment.</li>
<li>For clarity, the following CPU types have been removed: 6502C, 7501, 8500, 8501, 8502.<br />You can always refer to 6502 or 6510 instead, they are the same opcode-wise anyway.</li>
<li>Bug fixes.</li>
</ul>
