/****************************************************************************
* Retro Assembler Sample Code                      Last changed on 6/16/2020
* ==========================================================================
*
* Title: Hello Atari 800
*
* Target: Atari 800
*
* This sample shows how to create a really simple Hello World application,
* using the Atari's ROM functions to print on the screen.
*
* The file is auto-started after loading, handled by the "Launcher" segment.
*
* The code is clean, without any trickery for easy understanding.
